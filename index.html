                <h3>Henrietta Lacks' Story</h3>
               <p>
        Henrietta Lacks (1920-1951) was an African American woman who had her cervical cancer cells taken without her knowledge or consent during a medical examination at John Hopkins Hospital in 1951. Initially, Henrietta visited John Hopkins Hospital because of her vaginal bleeding, where it was later found out that she had a cancerous tumor on her cervix. She therefore underwent treatment at that hospital. Henrietta was a mother of five, said to be a vibrant, kind, and caring soul.

        John Hopkins was one of the few hospitals that treated poor African-Americans, so this was the hospital she was undergoing treatment at. Soon after these cells were taken, they were cultured in a way to make HeLa cells. These cells take the name after Henrietta Lacks, the first two letters from her first name and the last two letters from her last name.

        HeLa cells became a groundbreaking discovery as they had an ability to continuously divide and survive, upholding the characteristic of immortality. This research became essential in advancing medicine, such as playing a role in the development of the polio vaccine, cancer treatments, the COVID-19 vaccines, and much more.

        These achievements came at the cost of her exploitation, as her cells were cultured without her or her family’s knowledge. There was no compensation or reward offered to the Lacks family, causing this conflict of bioethics when it comes to families of lower socioeconomic status and marginalized groups.

        Throughout this website, I will be exploring Rebecca Skloot’s book, <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em>, and several other cases and legal precedents. I would like to focus my research and understanding of Henrietta’s story on these questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>• How did the law define “informed consent” and in which ways did the legal system fail to protect Henrietta Lacks?</li>
        <li>• How does Henrietta’s socioeconomic status and race play a role in how she was treated?</li>
        <li>• How do language and interpretation foster a sense of ambiguity within legal protections?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Ultimately, I want to understand the flaws within our legal framework when it comes to informed consent, medical ethics, and how this disproportionately affects marginalized people today.

        <section id="legal">
            <div class="section-content">
                <h3>Legal Injustices</h3>
                <p>The legal injustices that occurred in Henrietta Lacks’ case show how our legal system let her down. The term “informed consent” first appeared in <em>Salgo v. Leland Stanford Jr. University Board of Trustees (1957)</em>, and defined this term as requiring patients to be provided with sufficient information to make decisions on their medical treatment. This principle was not in the story of Henrietta Lacks, as it wasnt even defined, nor acknowledged yet. During this time there were many legal injustices towards marginalized groups, and even more to come. The African American community has gone through years of being let down by the safety of our system, and have been the target for most unethical practices. Even today, many Black Americans feel unsafe and are wary around medical professionals because of the history that surrounds bioethics and Black Americans. I believe that Henrietta’s socioeconomic status and race play a role in how she was treated, because of the vulnerable identity she identified as.  
</p>
                <h4>Voluntary and Informed Consent in our Legal System</h4>
                <p>As I mentioned before, The term “informed consent” first appeared in <em>Salgo v. Leland Stanford Jr. University Board of Trustees (1957)</em>, and defined this term as requiring patients to be provided with sufficient information to make decisions on their medical treatment. Yet, in 1947 the <em>Nuremberg Code</em> had the definition of “voluntary consent,” which requires participants to fully understand the risks, side effects, and hazardous materials one may undergo in a research experiment. The Nuremberg Code was developed in 1947 after the effects of the Holocaust, and 
served to establish a new standard of ethical medical behavior. It was a way to respond towards 
the inhumane treatment of humans, and also a way to lay out the rules for conducting research 
on humans. <em>The Nuremberg Code</em> undergoes 10 principles for conducting research on human 
patients, making sure to specify that the consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. It 
explains how the human subject should be in a place to make a conscious decision, with no 
ulterior motives such as force, constraint, or comprehension that could get in the way of the 
human subjects expressing their full opinion. This code is saying that the human subject must be aware and must understand what they will undergo, by also stating the hazardous effects that may happen during the process. The second principle is discussing how the experiment should be towards the good of humanity, allowing for a purposeful experiment. The other principles also discuss the prerequisite of having the same experiment be tested on animals first, before testing on humans.These principles make it clear that there needs to be that our research needs to be ethical, and purposeful from now on. 
</p>
                <h4>Legal Precedents</h4>
                <p>In Cases, such as <em>Salgo v. Leland Stanford Jr. University Board of Trustees (1957)</em> were not the only ones battling a sense of consent in medical practices. <em>Moore v. Regents of the University of California (1990)</em> was another case that showed how despite the legal writing of consent and bioethics, there was still a flaw in these systems. In Moore, the court ruled that patients do not retain ownership of their cells once removed, perpetuating ambiguity in informed consent laws. This brings us to the ambiguity in the writing of these legal documents, language and interpretation both show us how there needs to be an exact definition and description of this problem, in order to gain protection. Despite global consent laws, there still managed to be exploitation. These precedents reveal the ongoing gaps and staggering of change in legal protections, while also highlight the major damage to marginalized communities like Henrietta Lacks’ family.

            <div class="section-content">
                <h3>Ethical Implications</h3>
                <p>The story of Henrietta Lack’s displays many ethical concerns and questions on whether this was in any way justified. While many would agree that having the discovery of HeLa cells was able to scientifically improve humanity, even some of the Lacks’ family, it shouldn't have been discovered through unethical practices. The exploitation Henrietta experienced, not only shows how she was not in control of her body, but neither was her family. There was a lack of accountability on many of the companies and doctors who generated wealth from HeLa cells and those who experimented on a part of her. Her story shares that her family was always worrying about the pain she might have felt, while medical professionals were experimenting on her cells. And when HeLa cells made notable advances in scientific research and vaccines, there was no compensation or recognition of who these cells originated from. The simple act of going through with an experiment without someone's consent, is horrible as is, but exploiting this young woman’s cells for profit, and never truly giving back to the family, displays long time effects on the family and the African American community.

                <h3>Impact on Black Communities</h3>
                <p>The Black community in America has had history with unethical medical procedures, such as The Tuskegee Syphilis Study from 1932 to 1972. There has been a long distrust that marginalized groups have been faced with, but it;s even more disappointing when it continues to happen. This exploitation followed on to her children, where scientists collected their DNA without proper consent for the purpose of seeing if these “immortal” cells were genetic in their bloodline. This was a massive breach of privacy, as now their entire DNA build up was out in the public. These actions display the ongoing pattern that our Black community continues to face, and how it has created a divide within the medical professionals and our legal system, despite the laws set in place.
